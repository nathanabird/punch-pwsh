# US-0009 - Enter Category Using Index

## Description

As a user, I want to be able to enter a category by its index when punching in, so that I can quickly categorize my time entries.

## Acceptance Criteria

* **Given** the user is punched out or switching categories,
  **When** the system prompts for a category,
  **Then** the user can enter either the category name _or its index number_ to select it. (e.g., entering `1` for "IMS Maintenance" if it's the first category in the list - `punch in 1` is valid).
* **Given** the user provides an invalid index,
  **When** the system checks the index,
  **Then** an error message will be displayed.
* **Given** the system prompts for a category on punch out, switch, or on entering an invalid category,
  **When** the system displays the list of categories,
  **Then** each category will be numbered (starting from 1) for easy reference (e.g., `- {1} IMS Maintenance\n  - {2} IMS Enhancements\n...`).
