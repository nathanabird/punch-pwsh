# US-0015 - Enhance report command to show category statuses for day

## Description

As a user, I want the existing report command to be enhanced to include the status of each category worked on for the current day. This will provide users with a clearer overview of their tasks and priorities. I would like this to be implemented as a new subcommand for the report command, `day`. Original functionality will be placed under the new command `week`. (i.e., `punch report week`, `punch report day`)

## Acceptance Criteria

* **Given** the user has multiple categories with time entries for the current day,
  **When** the user runs the `punch report day` command,
  **Then** the report will include a section that lists each category worked on during the day, along with the total time spent on each category.
* **Given** the user has categories with weekly allotments,
  **When** the user runs the `punch report day` command,
  **Then** the report will include a section that shows the remaining time for each category's weekly allotment.
* **Given** the user has no categories with time entries for the current day,
  **When** the user runs the `punch report day` command,
  **Then** the report will indicate that no work was done for the day.
* **Given** the user has categories with no weekly allotments,
  **When** the user runs the `punch report day` command,
  **Then** the report will indicate that there are no weekly allotments set for those categories.
* **Given** the user runs the `punch report day` command,
  **When** the report is generated,
  **Then** the report will be formatted for readability and clarity.
* **Given** the original report functionality exists,
  **When** the new subcommands are implemented,
  **Then** the original functionality will be accessible under `punch report week`, and the enhanced daily report will be accessible under `punch report day`.
