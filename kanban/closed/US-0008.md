# User Story 8: Enhance Status with Category Progress (US-0008)

**As a user, when I check my status while punched into a category, I want to see my weekly progress for that specific category, so I have immediate context on my current task.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* The `punch status` command is modified.
* When punched in and assigned to a category with a weekly allotment, the status output will include:
  * The total time worked for that category in the current week.
  * The remaining time needed to meet the weekly goal for that category.
* If the current entry is "uncategorized" or the category has no weekly allotment, this extra information is not displayed.
