# User Story 1: Configure Work Categories (US-0001)

**As a user, I want to be able to define, list, and remove work categories and their weekly hour allotments so that I can manage my work buckets.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* A new `punch category` command.
* `punch category add <name> <weeklyHours>`: Adds a new category to the configuration.
* `punch category remove <name>`: Removes a category.
* `punch category list`: Lists all configured categories and their weekly hours.
* Categories should be stored persistently, likely in the `punch.xml` data file.
