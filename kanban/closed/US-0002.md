# User Story 2: Punch In with a Category (US-0002)

**As a user, I want to be able to specify a category when I punch in, so that my work time is associated with that category.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* Modify the `punch in` command to accept an optional category name (e.g., `punch in "IMS Maintenance"`).
  * i.e., `punch in [<category>]`
* The active punch-in session should be associated with the specified category.
* If a category is not provided, the entry will be marked as "uncategorized".
* The data entry in `punch.xml` for the session should include the category.
