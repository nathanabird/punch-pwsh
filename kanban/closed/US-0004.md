# User Story 4: View Weekly Progress Report (US-0004)

**As a user, I want to view a report of my time spent on each category for the current week, so I can see how I'm tracking against my weekly goals.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* A new `punch report` or enhanced `punch status` command.
* The report should show each category, the total time spent in the current week, and the progress towards the weekly goal (e.g., "IMS Maintenance: 2.5h / 4.0h").
* The report should calculate totals based on the current week (e.g., Monday to Sunday).
