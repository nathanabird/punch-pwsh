# US-0012 - View Time Entry Log

## Description

As a user, I want to view my past time entries with flexible filtering options, so I can review my work history and identify entries that may need correction.

## Acceptance Criteria

* **Given** the user wants to view recent time entries,
  **When** the user runs `punch log`,
  **Then** the system will display the last 10 time entries by default, showing start time, end time, duration, category, and a unique identifier for each entry.
* **Given** the user wants to see a specific number of entries,
  **When** the user runs `punch log <number>` (e.g., `punch log 25`),
  **Then** the system will display that many recent entries.
* **Given** the user wants to filter entries by time period,
  **When** the user runs `punch log --period <period>` where period can be `today`, `week`, `month`, or `all`,
  **Then** the system will display all entries within that time period.
* **Given** the user wants to see entries for a specific date,
  **When** the user runs `punch log --date <date>` (e.g., `punch log --date 2025-09-26`),
  **Then** the system will display all entries for that specific date.
* **Given** the user has no time entries,
  **When** the user runs `punch log`,
  **Then** the system will display "No time entries found."
* **Given** the system displays time entries,
  **When** the entries are shown,
  **Then** each entry will be numbered starting from 1 for easy reference in editing commands.
