# User Story 3: Switch Between Categories (US-0003)

**As a user, I want to be able to switch my active category without punching out and back in, so that I can accurately track my time when context-switching between tasks.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* A new `punch switch [<category>]` command.
* When switching, the current time entry is ended, and a new one is immediately started with the new category (either set explicitly or "uncategorized").
* If the entry being ended is "uncategorized", the user is prompted to select a category for it from the list of available categories.
* This provides a seamless way to transition between categorized tasks.
