# User Story 5: Recategorize and Manage Entries (US-0005)

**As a user, I want to be able to view my past time entries and change their category, so I can correct mistakes and organize my time log.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* A new `punch log` command that lists recent time entries, showing their start time, end time, duration, and category. Each entry should have a unique identifier (e.g., an index).
* A new `punch edit <entry_id> --category <new_category>` command to change the category of a specific entry.
* Using a special value like `uncategorized` or providing an empty string for the category (e.g., `punch edit <entry_id> --category ""`) will mark the entry as having an undefined category.
* The `punch.xml` entry will be updated to reflect the change.

## Update

Closed - Split into US-0012 and US-0013 for better separation of concerns.
