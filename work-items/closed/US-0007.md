# User Story 7: Deprecate Break Functionality (US-0007)

**As a developer, I want to remove the existing `punch break` functionality to simplify the tool and align with the new categorized time-tracking model.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* The `punch break` command is completely removed.
* All related code for starting and ending breaks is removed from `nbird11.Punch.psm1`.
* The `README.md` and usage instructions are updated to remove any mention of the `break` command.
* Breaks in the data model (nested inside entries) are no longer created, though the system should remain tolerant of old data containing them.
