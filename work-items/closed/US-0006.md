# User Story 6: Prompt for Category on Punch Out (US-0006)

**As a user, when I punch out, I want to be prompted to categorize my session if it was uncategorized, so that my time log remains accurate.**

## Acceptance Criteria

* When `punch out` is executed, if the current time entry is "uncategorized", the system will prompt the user to choose a category from the existing list.
* The user can select a category, and the time entry will be updated accordingly.
* The user can choose to leave it as "uncategorized".
