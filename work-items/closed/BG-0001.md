# BG-0001 - 'Clock Out At' only takes into account the most recent punch entry

## Description

The 'clock out at' feature should be calculated based on all the punch entries for today's date, not just the most recent entry. This means that if a user has multiple punch-ins and punch-outs throughout the day, the system should sum up all the worked hours to determine the correct clock out time.

## Repro Steps

1. Punch in at 9:00 AM.
2. Punch out at 12:00 PM.
3. Punch in at 1:00 PM.
4. Punch out at 5:00 PM.
5. Use the `punch status` command to check the 'clock out at' time.

## Resolution

**Fixed**: The 'clock out at' calculation now considers all punch entries for the current day.

**Additional Enhancements**:

- Status display now shows both current entry time and total time worked today
- Time formatting standardized to `hh:mm:ss` without fractional seconds for cleaner display
- Added comprehensive test coverage for multi-entry day scenarios

## Example Output

**Before fix:**

```text
Punched in.
Time so far this entry: 00:00:59
Clock out at 10:30 PM for an 8 hour day.
```

**After fix:**

```text
Punched in.
Time so far this entry: 00:06:06
Total time worked today: 02:32:36
Clock out at 10:30 PM for an 8 hour day.
```
