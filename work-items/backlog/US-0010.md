# US-0010 - Reset Specific Items of Punch Data

## Description

As a user, when I reset my time data, I want to specify which components of the punch data to reset.

## Acceptance Criteria

* **Given** the user does not indicate which components to reset,
  **When** the system performs a reset,
  **Then** the system will tell the user that they have not specified which components to reset.
* **Given** the user wants to reset category data,
  **When** the user specifies `categories` during the reset command,
  **Then** the category data will be reset.
* **Given** the user wants to reset time entries,
  **When** the user specifies `entries` during the reset command,
  **Then** the time entries will be reset.
* **Given** the user wants to reset multiple components,
  **When** the user specifies a comma-separated list (e.g., `categories, entries`) during the reset command,
  **Then** all specified components will be reset.
* **Given** the user wants to see what components can be reset,
  **When** the user specifies `--list` during the reset command,
  **Then** the system will display a list of components that can be reset (e.g., `categories`, `entries`).
* **Given** the user specifies `all` during the reset command,
  **When** the system performs the reset,
  **Then** all components of the punch data will be reset.
