# US-0017 - Improve status while punched out

## Description

As a user, the status when punched out after the system was upgraded to accomadate multiple entries per day is not very useful. Now, if I have an entry for today, I would like to see the total time so far for the whole day, and if I don't have any time entries for today, I would like to see the data for yesterday.

## Acceptance Criteria

* _Given_ the user is punched out and has at least one time entry for today  
  _When_ the user views their status  
  _Then_ the status displays the total time recorded for today
* _Given_ the user is punched out and has no time entries for today  
  _When_ the user views their status  
  _Then_ the status displays the total time recorded for yesterday
* _Given_ the user is punched out  
  _When_ the user views their status  
  _Then_ the status clearly indicates that the user is currently punched out
