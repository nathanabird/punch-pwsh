# US-0016 - Fully remove support for deprecated break data

## Description

As a developer, I don't want to have to support the deprecated break functionality. User who still have break data in their punch data have had sufficient time to move on from using this deprecated feature, but if they really need the data, they can be prompted to export their punch log and reset (specifically their time data, see US-0010)

## Acceptance Criteria

* **Given** legacy break data exists in a user's punch log
  **When** the module loads the log
  **Then** the deprecated break fields are ignored (not mapped to any active model)
  **And** a single deprecation warning is emitted per session with guidance to export and reset
  **And** no break-related columns or properties appear in any command output or new exports
* **Given** legacy break data exists and the user runs the reset operation (per US-0010) without prior export
  **When** the command detects deprecated break fields
  **Then** the user is prompted to optionally export the full punch log (including legacy break fields) before purge
  **And** confirming export produces a file containing the legacy break data
  **And** confirming the reset removes only the time data (categories remain intact)
* **Given** legacy break data exists and the user declines export during reset
  **When** the user confirms proceeding
  **Then** the time data, including deprecated break fields, are irreversibly removed
  **And** a final confirmation message states the old time data is no longer recoverable from the system
* **Given** no legacy break data exists
  **When** any punch command runs
  **Then** no deprecation warning is shown
  **And** performance is not degraded compared to prior behavior
