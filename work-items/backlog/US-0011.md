# US-0011 - Separate Tests into Multiple Files

## Description

As a developer, I want to organize the tests into multiple files based on their functionality, so that the test suite is easier to navigate and maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

* **Given** the current test suite is in a single or two files,
  **When** the tests are organized,
  **Then** the tests will be separated into multiple files based on their functionality (e.g., `Punch.Category.Tests.ps1`, `Punch.Entry.Tests.ps1`, `Punch.Report.Tests.ps1`).
* **Given** the tests are separated,
  **When** the tests have BeforeAll and AfterAll blocks,
  **Then** these blocks will be moved to a common setup file (e.g., `TestSetup.ps1`) that is imported by each test file.
